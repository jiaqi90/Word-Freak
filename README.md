#Word-Freak

This app allows users to input a URL and the most commonly used words will be displayed. Mainly created to refamiliarize myself with Python and the setup environment as well as to learn about different technologies such as Redis, PostgreSQL. Thanks to https://github.com/mjhea0 for his python tutorial on realpython to setup the backend
